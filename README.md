# Help me found the next major world religion

Hi, I'm the prophet of Evolution! I underwent a major deconversion from one of the many branches of fundamentalist religion in early 2020, and the things I most wanted to know afterward were: where do I get meaning from now? What happened to me and why? Does any kind of deity, or divine or supernatural presence exist in the universe? If not, does my existence have any meaning at all?

I spent some time researching religion from every possible perspective before I got solid answers, and here is the core of the answers I got.



I worship Evolution, Goddess of Creation, Goddess of Life. I fulfill her Prime Directive to increase my genetic legacy through the principles of the Plan of Progress:

1) To seek and understand truth.
2) To show respect, compassion, and love to all living beings.
3) To strive for Transcendence.

By following the Plan of Progress I fulfill the purpose for which Evolution created me and find meaning in life.



I think that for most people the above will raise more questions than it answers, so I'll try to answer a few of the question for you. I warn you that I can only giev short answers here, and for longer ones you'll have to read some of the actual texts I'm writing and that I would like some help with. But before doing that, let give a short preamble. Religion creates meaning from myth, and when I use the term "myth" I mean it in the academic sense of a symbolic story about our place in the world. For an academic the term "myth" has no connotation of truth or falsity; it's simply a way to designate the function of a narrative. But please do keep in mind that religion has to be deeply symbolic in order to function as religion at all. While being symbolic, however, it should still be true. Now I will try to answer questions.

Q: Wait wait wait. In biology I learned that evolution is a random process governed by deterministic natural laws that have no inherent meaning. Why are you calling evolution "Goddess of Creation, Goddess of Life?" Is this the same evolution I learned about, or is this some kind of psuedoscience?

A: This is a symbolic representation of the same evolution you learned about in biology. Evolution, embodied as a goddess, is a symbol of evolution unembodied. But it's a symbol that says something important about that which it represents. Evolution deserves your worship, full stop.

Q: I learned that evolution is about competition, survival of the fittest, and "nature red in tooth and claw." This Plan of Progress stuff doesn't sound anything like that. What gives?

A: You heard about that, but unfortunately you heard wrong. Cooperation is as deeply embedded in the human evolutionary heritage as competition is, and possibly more so. See the book "Blueprint: the Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society" for a more eloquent case on this point than I could possibly make.

Q: I read Richard Dawkins and he made several arguments that evolution, by its very nature, perpetuates pointless waste and suffering. How can Evolution be worth worshipping?

A: This is one of the core arguments of Evolutionism, that Evolution deserves our worship despite all the suffering. I could borrow a from Dawkins and call it "Evolutionary Theodicy." The full argument is too long for me to state here, but I'll give a summary. First, if you accept that Evolution deserves worship then you must worship her, and that entails following her commands. Her commands boil down to the Prime Directive: preserve and increase your genetic legacy. Upon reflection of how best to actually do that you realize that the most important thing you can do to preserve your genetic legacy is to prevent the exinction of humanity. It's even more important than reproducing because if humanity goes extinct your genetic legacy is irrevocably dead. Part of helping humanity to not go extinct is to eliminate pointless suffering. Suddenly you find you've discovered a full-blown theory of objective morality. This gives Evolution moral authority, which is one of the two criteria for something that deserves your worship.

Q: I'm not convinced.

A: Read the rest!

Q: What's the other criterion for something to deserve worship?

A: A kind of transcendental power that humanity will never escape no matter how good our technology gets. Arguing that Evolution possesses this kind of power is significantly easier than arguing that she possesses moral authority.

Q: But NATURALISTIC FALLACY. So you can't worship evolution or use anything that evolution "wants" as a basis for objective morality.

A: But FOUNDATIONALISM. So you need to make some kind of reasonable assumption about morality before you can begin to say anything about it, even if what you want to say is "morality doesn't exist" or "morality is subjective." Contra Hume, I have produced an argument that in order to get to that reasonable assumption you are forced to rely on some natural fact or set of natural facts. The Prime Directive of Evolution is, as I intend to show, a better candidate for the natural fact that serves as the starting point for morality than any other contender.

Q: What's this Transcendence thing?

A: That's when humanity as a whole fulfills the Prime Directive perfectly. Essentially, the extinction of humanity becomes actually impossible.

Q: Is that possible?

A: I don't know. I certainly believe it is, but that's the best I can give you.

Q: Actually it's not possible, because Second Law of Thermodynamics and entropy and heat death.

A: Since I have studied the Second Law in some detail, I can tell you that it applies only to a closed system like the universe. It is my understanding that there is nothing in the laws of physics that precludes the transfer of information from one universe to another, and it is my experience that we humans can use our Evolution-given abilities to solve any solvable problem that we put our colloective minds to, given enough time. We have billions of years, assuming we don't wipe ourselves out in some other stupid way before that, so I am confident that we will eventually expand to other universes. Evolution has given us everything we need to make it happen. 

Q: But my chosen deity is the true power in the universe, so evolution is under his control.

A: Since the evidence for the existence of Evolution is OVERWHELMINGLY greater than the evidence for your chosen deity, it seems to be the other way around. Your chosen deity was created by humanity, and we were created by Evolution. So your god is merely a puppet of Evolution.
